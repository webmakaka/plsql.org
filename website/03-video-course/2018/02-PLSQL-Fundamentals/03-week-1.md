# Oracle MOOC : PL/SQL Fundamentals (2018) : Lesson 1:  Introducing Oracle PL/SQL


Do you know that Oracle PL/SQL was introduced more than 20 years ago, in early 90s as a key component of Oracle Database version 6.0? Today, it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Wonder why?

Because it combines the power of SQL and the features of a powerful programming language. Just by extending SQL, and writing procedural statements around them, you can develop a database application quickly and easily!

To understand more about Oracle PL/SQL, letâ€™s begin the first week of our journey in this 3 week MOOC !

This week covers the following topics:

* Introduction to Oracle Cloud
* Benefits and features of PL/SQL
* PL/SQL architecture and execution flow of PL/SQL statements
* PL/SQL block structure and types of blocks
* Declaring and using PL/SQL variables and bind variables
* Data types supported by PL/SQL
* Lexical units and data type conversions in PL/SQL
* Scope and visibility of PL/SQL variables in nested blocks

We provide video instructions along with homework to guide you through Oracle PL/SQL concepts. Please watch each video carefully to ensure that  you get the information you need to complete this lesson. For best results, we recommend that you watch the videos in the order in which they are listed.  At the end of each lesson, don't forget to take the quiz.

As you progress through the materials, you will notice that a green check mark is added next to each item that you complete. This helps you track your progress. Don't hesitate to ask a question in the PL/SQL MOOC community if you hit a snag.

Enjoy!
