# Oracle MOOC : SQL Fundamentals (2018) : Lesson 1: Introducing Oracle SQL


SQL has been around for over 30 years. So why are we still teaching people this language? And why do they want to learn it? And why is it one of the most popular programming languages in the world today?

Because it's one of the most successful technologies for managing data in a database that has ever been created. Even with all the changes that have taken place in software and hardware in the past decades, SQL remains the most popular, powerful and effective way to work with data.

Let's begin!

This week covers the following topics:

* Introduction to Oracle Cloud
* Relational database concepts
* Data storage terminologies
* Introduction to Oracle SQL

We provide video instructions along with homework to guide you through Oracle SQL concepts. Please watch each video carefully to ensure that  you get the information you need to complete this lesson. The videos and tutorials are listed sequentially, and we recommend that you use the instructional materials in that order. At the end of each lesson, don't forget to take the quiz.

As you progress through the materials, you will notice that the Oracle Learning Library adds a green check mark next to each item that you have accessed (You must be logged in). This helps you track your progress. Don't hesitate to ask a question in the SQL MOOC community if you hit a snag.

Enjoy!
