# Hi!

If you study Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and any other Oracle technologies, you can share your experience with us.  
For this we can share link on you social network profile. I think, it can help find a better job (May be even remote).  

Or you can write what you are developer / consultant on your resume with proofs on this website. 

May be your experience will help to newbie. 

If it will be interesting to you , join to our <a href="https://oracledba.net/chat/">chat</a>. You can ask something interesting for you or we can speak not only about Oracle.
