# Hi!

If you study Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and any other Oracle technologies, you can share your experience with us.

For this we can share link on you social network profile. I think, it can help find a better job (May be even remote).

Or you can write what you are Oracle Developer / Consultant on your resume with proofs on this website.

May be your experience will help to newbie. Or more experienced developer will help you.

If it will be interesting to you, join to our <a href="https://oracledba.net/chat/">chat</a>. You can ask something interesting for you or we can speak not only about Oracle.

Sorry for my English. I studied german in the school.
